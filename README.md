# Eyes

# Link https://dukeofnowhere.github.io/Portfolio/Projects.html

# Description
In this project, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the eyes displayed on the page. 


# How To Run
Click on the link above. It will take you to the "Projects" page. Click "Run Code" on the "Wild Eyes" Project. 
When the page loads, move your mouse around and notice how the eyes track the movement of your mouse.  

# Roadmap
I would like to add more features to this page that interact with the movement and location of the mouse.
The idea would be to have the eye's or even the page change colors depending on where the mouse is located specifically.
